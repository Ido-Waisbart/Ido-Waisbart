- [Adrift](https://blawnode.itch.io/adrift) - Since May 2022, I have been managing a group of 6 teammates (including myself. Now, we're 3.), to work on our personal jam game, which was made in a limited amount of time. The continuation has started in about the middle of July 2022, and is still ongoing, if slowly.

- [Triple Triangle](https://blawnode.itch.io/threeangle) - A simple - yet polished - mobile 2D game, made alone in Unity for over a year.
Includes systematic manager scripts, a shop screen and basic ads.
Being limited to not make art nor music for the game, I focused my powers on the code.

- [A maze generator and Genetic Algorithm solver in Python.][ga-maze-link] - Generates, saves, loads and solves custom-made mazes. Made using the Pillow and tikinter modules.
<!-- TODO: Screenshots! -->

- [Encrypto/En-crypts][encrypto-link] - A library for text encrypting, made in C#, as my final project for my high-school's Computer Science class. Employs Caesar, Vigenere, RSA and AES.

- Several game jams. In each, I fulfilled a different role: Unity/Godot Programmer, pixel artist/animator, chiptune musician, or sometimes all of them.

  **My best jam works:**:
