- [idow.xyz/Portfolio Website](https://blawnode.itch.io/threeangle) - A React.js project, including usage of: AWS Amplify hosting, Sass, PostgreSQL database connection, Bootstrap, responsiveness, and more.
Made as both a large React.js exercise, and a website for my services and projects.

- [Triple Triangle](https://blawnode.itch.io/threeangle) - A simple - yet polished - mobile 2D game, made alone in Unity for over a year.
Includes systematic manager scripts, a shop screen and basic ads.
Being limited to not make art nor music for the game, I focused my powers on the code.

- [Adrift](https://blawnode.itch.io/adrift) - I will continue managing a group of 6 teammates (including myself), to work on our personal jam game, which was in a limitted amount of time. The continuation will hopefully happen in about the middle of July, 2022.

### Notable past/finished projects
- [A maze generator and Genetic Algorithm solver in Python.][ga-maze-link] - Generates, saves, loads and solves custom-made mazes. Made using the Pillow and tikinter modules.
<!-- TODO: Screenshots! -->

- [Encrypto/En-crypts][encrypto-link] - A library for text encrypting, made in C#, as my final project for my high-school's Computer Science class. Employs Caesar, Vigenere, RSA and AES.

- Several game jams. In each, I fulfilled a different role: Unity/Godot Programmer, pixel artist/animator, chiptune musician, or sometimes all of them.

  **My best jam works:**:
